Hi, I’m @wilmapal;  aka Wilma Palombo
- 
I’m interested in learning new tools, languages, paradigms, and processes
-     to further enlighten my perception and integration of a life history
-     that includes experiences with community research and development processes, 
-     archival research into the origins/development/evolution of communities of women religious,
-     and participation in creating content for/with the Sisters of St. Joseph (CSJ) of Baden, PA.
I’m currently learning about Community Archives in a graduate level course at the University of Pittsburgh:  
-     what they are, as distinct from institutional archives; 
-     who has them and where; 
-     how they manage, store, organize and manifest the histoy of a community;     
I’m looking to collaborate on future develpments with the CSJ Archives 
      and their contribution to both local and global historical research.
